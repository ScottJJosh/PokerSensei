Roboflow is an end-to-end computer vision platform that helps you
* collaborate with your team on computer vision projects
* collect & organize images
* understand and search unstructured image data
* annotate, and create datasets
* export, train, and deploy computer vision models
* use active learning to improve your dataset over time

The dataset includes 1505 images.
Poker-Chip-Stacks are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)
* Auto-contrast via adaptive equalization

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random rotation of between -30 and +30 degrees
* Random shear of between -30째 to +30째 horizontally and -30째 to +30째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -35 and +35 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -38 and +38 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 5 percent of pixels

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2 pixels
